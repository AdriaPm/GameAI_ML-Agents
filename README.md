# GameAI Exercise 07: ML Agents
## About
The following repository was created to host class exercise 07 from Game AI lesson in CITM UPC university.

The main objective of this exercise was to create a Unity scene with a Rolling Ball which chases a given Target. The principal goal was to train the Rolling Ball using Machine Learning. To do so, we used Unity game engine in its **2022.3.3f1 version** and some free assets from the Unity Assets Store and then we implemented the algorithm using C# Unity scripts.
